# 🎥 Motion Detection using OpenCV

This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect motion from a live webcam feed. It applies background subtraction and contour detection to identify moving objects in real time.

## 📌 Features

- Detects motion using frame differencing
- Highlights moving objects with rectangles
- Displays live camera feed
- Easy to run with Python

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the required libraries before running the project:

pip install opencv-python imutils


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository:
   - [Download ZIP](https://github.com/SANTHOSH-201EE195/Motion-Detector-CV/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
   - Or clone using Git:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/SANTHOSH-201EE195/Motion-Detector-CV.git
     ```

2. Open terminal in the project folder.

3. Run the script:
python motion_detector.py

4. Your webcam will turn on. If motion is detected, it will be highlighted with green rectangles.

5. Press `e` to exit the webcam window.
